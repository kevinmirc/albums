<!-- 
Something wrong with this loop. Keeps generating way too many html elements for each piece of data
for ex: there is like 10 image tags and "see track" links for one each album 

Going to learn more html and refresh myself in erb and come back to re write this to work
-->

	<% @albums.each do |album| %>
		<%= image_tag album.cover %>
		<%= album.title %>
		<%= album.artist %>
		<%= link_to "See Tracks", album_path(album) %>
		<div>
	<% end %>
